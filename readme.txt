editorial arguing that the pandemic response by the clinical academic community has been poor and ineffective

- not a time for fancy science, boots on the ground
	- and top down / public health style intervention approaches
	- ?can you find an example of when a disease was properly tackled
		- ??
	- these things can be answered quickly
		- simulation to show numbers needed considering the typical hospital LOS
- without evidence
	- drugs cause harm: cite the SARS steroids and ribavirin articles
- not just about drugs, intensive care: a complex intervention
	- the processes are super important: wit the decision to build Nightingale
		- two key delivery issues
			- ventilators: depends on the early vs late IMV qn
			- fluid management: current shortage of RRT
		- bigger question: switching off acute medical services?
			- nonCOVID harm
- general trial points
	- late endpoints: 30-90d
		- remap-cap modifying primary endpoint
	- slow recruitment: remap-cap 227
- specific trials
	- recovery-support
		- london hospitals not recruiting
		- not appropriate design wrt to endpoints
	- remap-cap
		- https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02735707
		- complicated; slow but the right approach; needs to be mandated but with simpler more agile data collection
